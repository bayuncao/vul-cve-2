There is a command execution vulnerability in the qlib project

I discovered the remote command execution vulnerability of the qlib project through codeql. Since `Serializable` in `utils/serial.py` in the `qlib` project is a general class, many data loading methods in the project use `Serializable`'s `to_pickle` method and `load` method. Perform input processing on the dataset. At the same time, `import pickle as pkl` is also used in the `/contrib/data/highfreq_provider.py` file to process the dataset file. By constructing a malicious `.pkl` file, I can write the command to be executed into the `.pkl` file. When qlib loads the `.pkl` file, the command will be executed successfully. The relevant code locations have been stored in the `picture` directory.
